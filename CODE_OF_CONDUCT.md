# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We are committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Positive behaviors include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Showing empathy toward other community members  

Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission  
- Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior and may take appropriate, fair corrective action in response to violations. While Gravitrips is lightly maintained, serious concerns will be reviewed and addressed as needed.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces and when an individual represents the Gravitrips project in public or community contexts (e.g., issues, pull requests, discussions, chats, or events).

## Enforcement
Report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the project maintainer at `bpg1968@gmail.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed appropriate to the circumstances.
